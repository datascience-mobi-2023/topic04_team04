	The time series of total dengue cases in Thailand was additively decomposed in the components trend, seasonal and random, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:decomp_ts_dengue}. The time series shows a seasonal pattern with a frequency of 12 months. The trend shows fluctuation over the time period with two periods of comparatively high dengue cases.

	The composition of the time series of the dengue cases was compared to the decomposition of the time series of temperatures. Both time series have an annual seasonal pattern. The trends show in general similar patterns with differences in the amplitudes and slight shifts on the time axis, as shown in figure y.
