\section{Material and Methods}

	\paragraph{ERA5 data (climate)}
	The ERA5 database is a global climate database by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), covering the earth in a 31 km horizontal grid up to 80 km in the atmosphere in the time period from 1950 to present. It was generated from measurements of various climate variables combined with a reanalysis of existing data and past reanalysis data to accurately model and complete the dataset in the given resolution \citep{Hersbach2020}. For this project, monthly temperature data 2m above ground for every province in Thailand in the timeframe of 2006 - 2020 was extracted.
	\paragraph{Dengue data}
	The Dengue case numbers were retrieved from annual infectious disease reports published by the Thailand ministry of health. Monthly case numbers of DHF for every province in the timeframe of 2006 - 2020 were used in this project. 
	
	Both datasets were used with a resolution at province level. As of 2011, Thailand has a total of 77 provinces, but had 76 provinces before 2011, as Bueng Kan was split from Nong Khai in 2011. For better compatibility of the data before and after 2011, the two new provinces were merged into a province equivalent to Nong Khai before 2011. 
	
	\paragraph{Descriptive analysis}
	Linear regression is a method to describe a linear relationship between variables, using the minimum sum of squares between regression line and data points to identify possible trends \citep{Schneider2010}.
