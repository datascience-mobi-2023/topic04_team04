 abstract = {{\dq}As the amount of information in biology expands dramatically, it becomes increasingly important for textbooks to distill the vast amount of scientific knowledge into concise principles and enduring concepts. As with previous editions, Molecular Biology of the Cell, Sixth Edition accomplishes this goal with clear writing and beautiful illustrations. The Sixth Edition has been extensively revised and updated with the latest research in the field of cell biology, and it provides an exceptional framework for teaching and learning. The entire illustration program has been greatly enhanced. Protein structures better illustrate structure-function relationships, icons are simpler and more consistent within and between chapters, and micrographs have been refreshed and updated with newer, clearer, or better images. As a new feature, each chapter now contains intriguing open-ended questions highlighting {\dq}What We Don't Know,{\dq} introducing students to challenging areas of future research. Updated end-of-chapter problems reflect new research discussed in the text. Thought-provoking end-of-chapter questions have been expanded to all chapters, including questions on developmental biology, tissues and stem cells, the immune system, and pathogens{\dq}--},

@article{Liu2014,
	abstract = {Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that occurs mainly in the tropics and subtropics but has a high potential to spread to new areas. Dengue infections are climate sensitive, so it is important to better understand how changing climate factors affect the potential for geographic spread and future dengue epidemics. Vectorial capacity (VC) describes a vector's propensity to transmit dengue taking into account human, virus, and vector interactions. VC is highly temperature dependent, but most dengue models only take mean temperature values into account. Recent evidence shows that diurnal temperature range (DTR) plays an important role in influencing the behavior of the primary dengue vector Aedes aegypti. In this study, we used relative VC to estimate dengue epidemic potential (DEP) based on the temperature and DTR dependence of the parameters of A. aegypti. We found a strong temperature dependence of DEP; it peaked at a mean temperature of 29.3°C when DTR was 0°C and at 20°C when DTR was 20°C. Increasing average temperatures up to 29°C led to an increased DEP, but temperatures above 29°C reduced DEP. In tropical areas where the mean temperatures are close to 29°C, a small DTR increased DEP while a large DTR reduced it. In cold to temperate or extremely hot climates where the mean temperatures are far from 29°C, increasing DTR was associated with increasing DEP. Incorporating these findings using historical and predicted temperature and DTR over a two hundred year period (1901-2099), we found an increasing trend of global DEP in temperate regions. Small increases in DEP were observed over the last 100 years and large increases are expected by the end of this century in temperate Northern Hemisphere regions using climate change projections. These findings illustrate the importance of including DTR when mapping DEP based on VC. © 2014 Liu-Helmersson et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Despite intensive vector control efforts, dengue epidemics continue to occur throughout Southeast Asia in multi-annual cycles. Weather is considered an important factor in these cycles, but the extent to which the El Nĩo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a driving force behind dengue epidemics remains unclear. Methods. We examined the temporal relationship between El Nĩo and the occurrence of dengue epidemics, and constructed Poisson autoregressive models for incidences of dengue cases. Global ENSO records, dengue surveillance data, and local meteorological data in two geographically diverse regions in Thailand (the tropical southern coastal region and the northern inland mountainous region) were analyzed. Results. The strength of El Nĩo was consistently a predictor for the occurrence of dengue epidemics throughout time lags from 1 to 11 months in the two selected regions of Thailand. Up to 22% (in 8 northern inland mountainous provinces) and 15% (in 5 southern tropical coastal provinces) of the variation in the monthly incidence of dengue cases were attributable to global ENSO cycles. Province-level predictive models were fitted using 1996-2004 data and validated with out-of-fit data from 2005. The multivariate ENSO index was an independent predictor in 10 of the 13 studied provinces. Conclusion. El Nĩo is one of the important driving forces for dengue epidemics across the geographically diverse regions of Thailand; however, spatial heterogeneity in the effect exists. The effects of El Nĩo should be taken into account in future epidemic forecasting for public health preparedness. © 2009 Tipayamongkholgul et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	ABSTRACT = {Flash floods are water-related disasters that cause damage to properties, buildings, and infrastructures in the flow path. Flash floods often occur within a short period of time following intense rainfall in the high, mountainous area of northern Thailand. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to generate a flash flood susceptibility map using watershed morphometric parameters and hydrological approaches. In this study, the Pai River basin, located in Mae Hong Son in northern Thailand, is divided into 86 subwatersheds, and 23 morphometric parameters of the watershed are extracted from the digital elevation model (DEM). In addition, the soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) model is used to estimate the precipitation excess, and Snyder&rsquo;s synthetic unit hydrograph method is used to estimate the time to peak and time of concentration. With respect to the rainfall dataset, in this study, we combined CHIRPS data (as satellite gridded precipitation data) with rainfall data measured within the study area for the runoff analysis. According to the analysis results, 25 out of 86 subwatersheds are classified as highly susceptible areas to flash floods. The similarities in the morphometric parameters representing watersheds in highly flash flood-susceptible areas indicate that this categorization included areas with high relief, high relief ratios, high ruggedness ratios, high stream frequencies, high texture ratios, high annual runoff, high peak discharge, low elongation ratios, and low lemniscates ratios.},

@article{Hu2020,
	abstract = {The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is regarded as one of the most important factors for onset of the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM). Previous studies generally indicated that an El Niño event tends to result in a late onset of the SCSSM monsoon. However, this relationship has not been true in recent years, particularly when an extremely early SCSSM onset (1 May 2019) occurred following the 2018/19 El Niño event in the preceding winter. The processes of the second earliest SCSSM onset in the past 41 years were investigated using NCEP-DOE reanalysis, OLR data, and ERSST. A negative sea surface temperature and associated anticyclonic anomalies were absent over the western North Pacific in the late spring of 2019 following an El Niño event in the preceding winter. Thus, the mean circulation in the late spring of 2019 does not prevent SCSSM onset, which is in sharp contrast to the composited spring of the El Niño decaying years. The convective active and westerly phases of a 30-60-day oscillation originating from the Indian Ocean provided a favorable background for the SCSSM onset in 2019. In addition, the monsoon onset vortex over the Bay of Bengal and the cold front associated with a midlatitude trough over East Asia also played important roles in triggering the early onset of the SCSSM in 2019. No tropical cyclone appeared over the western North Pacific during April and May, and the enhancement of quasi-biweekly oscillation mainly occurs after the SCSSM onset; thus, these two factors contribute little to the SCSSM onset in 2019.},

	abstract = {Background: Geographical maldistribution has been a critical concern of health workforce planning in Thailand for years. This study aimed to assess the equity of health workforce distribution in public hospitals affiliated to the Office of Permanent Secretary (OPS) of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) through the application of “concentration index” (CI). Methods: A cross sectional quantitative design was employed. The dataset comprised 1) health workforce data from the OPS, MOPH in 2016, 2) regional and provincial-level economic data from the National Economic and Social Development Board in 2015, and 3) population data from the Ministry of Interior in 2015. Descriptive statistics, Spearman’s rank correlation, and CI analysis were performed. Results: Thailand had 2.04 health professionals working in public facilities per 1,000 population. Spearman’s correlation found positive relationship in all health professionals. Yet, statistical significance was not found in most health professionals but doctors (P<0.001). Positive correlation was observed in all health cadres at regional and provincial hospitals (rs=0.348, P=0.002). In the CI analysis, the distribution of health professionals across provincial income was relatively equitable in all cadres. Significant CIs were found in doctor density (CI =0.055, P=0.001), all professionals density at district hospitals (CI =-0.049, P=0.012), and all professionals density at provincial and regional hospitals (CI =0.078, P=0.003). Conclusion: The positive CIs implied that the distribution of all health professionals, especially doctors, at provincial and regional hospitals slightly favored the richer provinces. In contrast, the distribution at district hospitals was slightly more concentrated in less well-off provinces. From a macro-view, the distribution of all health professionals in Thailand was relatively equitable across provincial economic status. This might be due to the extensive health infrastructure development and rural retention policies over the past four decades.},

	abstract = {Although previous research frequently indicates that climate factors impact dengue transmission, the results are inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis highlights and address the complex global health problems towards the human-environment interface and the inter-relationship between these variables. For this purpose, four online electronic databases were searched to conduct a systematic assessment of published studies reporting the association between dengue cases and climate between 2010 and 2022. The meta-analysis was conducted using random effects to assess correlation, publication bias and heterogeneity. The final assessment included eight studies for both systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of four meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the correlation of dengue cases with climate variables, namely precipitation, temperature, minimum temperature and relative humidity. The highest correlation is observed for precipitation between 83 mm and 15 mm (r = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.31, 0.45), relative humidity between 60.5% and 88.7% (r = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.23, 0.37), minimum temperature between 6.5 °C and 21.4 °C (r = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.48) and mean temperature between 21.0 °C and 29.8 °C (r = 0.07, 95% CI = −0.1, 0.24). Thus, the influence of climate variables on the magnitude of dengue cases in terms of their distribution, frequency, and prevailing variables was established and conceptualised. The results of this meta-analysis enable multidisciplinary collaboration to improve dengue surveillance, epidemiology, and prevention programmes.},
